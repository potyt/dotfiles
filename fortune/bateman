Is that Donald Trump's car?
%
Oh, that? Just mulling over business problems, examining opportunities, exchanging rumors, spreading gossip.
%
So, Dorsia is where Jean wants to go.
%
I'm trying to listen to the new Robert Palmer tape, but Evelyn Williams, my supposed fiancee, keeps buzzing in my ear.
%
Get a goddamn job, Al!!
%
Jean? I need help!
%
I believe in taking care of myself and a balanced diet and rigorous exercise routine.
%
Don't wear that outfit again.
%
Pumpkin, you're dating an asshole. Pumpkin, you're dating the biggest dickweed in New York.
%
So, uh, wasn't Rothchild originally handling the Fisher account? How'd you get it?
%
Allen has mistaken me for this dickhead, Marcus Halberstram.
%
Listen, the mud soup and charcoal arugula are outrageous here.
%
You can always be thinner. Look... better.
%
Well, does Marcus have an alibi?
%
I can't believe that Bryce prefers Van Patten's card to mine.
%
It's time for Paul to take a little trip. Where do I send the bastard? Dallas? Paris? Singapore? London? I'll send the asshole to London.
%
So listen. What do you really wanna do with your life? And don't tell me you enjoy working with children, okay?
%
There are definite dos and don'ts, good buddy of wearing a bold striped shirt.
%
'In Too Deep' is the most moving pop song of the 1980s, about monogamy and commitment.
%
I'm Paul. My name's Paul Allen. You got that?
%
I don't think I'm gonna make it, Jean, to the, uh, office this afternoon.
%
Lime? You sure? I can always get you a lime.
%
He's been compared to Elvis Costello, but I think Huey has a far more bitter, cynical sense of humor.
%
Late. Aerobics class. Sorry. Any messages?
%
Bleaching? Are you trying to say bleaching?
%
Christie, get down on your knees so Sabrina can see your asshole.
%
Howard, it's Bateman. Patrick Bateman. You're my lawyer, so I think you should know I've killed a lot of people.
%
Um, yes, I know it's a little late, but is it possible to reserve a table for two at 8:00 or 8:30, perhaps?
%
I'm trying to listen to the new Robert Palmer tape, but Evelyn, my supposed fiance, keeps buzzing in my ear.
%
...he also has a penchant for Valentino suits and Oliver Peoples glasses.
%
Be a doll and just get me a mineral water, okay?
%
Marcus and I even go to the same barber, although I have a slightly better haircut.
%
Listen. I would just like to see... the two of you... get it on.
%
Come on. Don't you find Christie attractive?
%
This won't be anything like last time. I promise.
%
Christie, you're not drinking your wine.
%
This is Paul. I've been called away to London for a few days. Meredith, I'll call you when I get back. Hastalavista, baby.
%
Christie, look at the camera.
%
Pumpkin, you're dating an asshole. Pumpkin, you're dating the biggest dickweed in New York.
%
I have to return some videotapes.
%
I guess I was probably returning videotapes.
%
I'm fucking serious. It's fucking over, us. This is no joke. Uh, I don't think we should see each other anymore.
%
Not if you want to keep your spleen.
%
I'm fairly certain that Timothy Bryce and Evelyn are having an affair.
%
You're dating Luis, he's in Arizona. You're fucking me and we haven't made plans. What could you possibly be up to tonight?
%
I like to dissect girls. Did you know I'm utterly insane?
%
Jean, great jacket. Matsuda?
%
Is that all you ever have to contribute Van Patten, what about fucking dinner!?
%
You can practically hear every nuance of every instrument. Sabrina, remove your dress.
%
Well, actually Christie, that's none of your business, but I can assure you it certainly wasn't cheap.
%
So... don't you wanna know what I do?
%
I don't want you to get drunk, but that's a very fine chardonnay you're not drinking.
%
You like Huey Lewis and the News?
%
Did you know that Ted Bundy's first dog, a collie, was named Lassie? *laughs*
%
I want you to clean your vagina.
%
So, where do you workout?
%
This is "Sussudio", a great, great song - a personal favorite.
%
A bold striped shirt calls for solid colored or discreetly patterned suits and ties.
%
Sabrina, why don't you dance a little?
%
Duct tape. I need it for... taping something.
%
Well, for one thing, I think he was probably a closet homosexual who did a lot of cocaine. That Yale thing.
%
Impressive. Very nice. Let's see Paul Allen's card.
%
You're a fucking ugly bitch! I want to stab you to death, and then play around with your blood.
%
Don't touch the watch.
%
She's my ... cousin. She's from ... France.
%
Mistletoe alert!
%
That's bone. And the lettering is something called Silian Rail.
%
Look at that subtle off-white coloring; the tasteful thickness of it... Oh my God. It even has a watermark.
%
You're Christie. You're to respond only to Christie. Is that clear?
%
Not quite blonde, are we? More of a dirty blonde.
%
And Jean, you'll wanna change before we go out.
%
We'd gone to a new musical... called 'Oh Africa, Brave Africa.' It was a laugh riot.
%
Hang out? Let me think. Um, the Newport, Harry's, Fluties, Indochine, Nell's, the Cornell Club, the New York Yacht Club...
%
Not a menorah. You spin a dreidel.
%
Can't, I'm afraid. I've got a matinee of Les Mis. Listen, I really gotta go. Oh, Christ... I'll call you.
%
Jean? Would you like to accompany me to dinner? That is, if you're not doing anything.
%
Hmmmm, I see they've omitted the pork loin with lime Jell-O.
%
You know, Courtney, you should take some more lithium or have a Diet Coke.
%
Some caffeine might get you out of this slump.
%
New York Matinee called it 'a playful but mysterious little dish.' You'll love it.
%
I'd like a girl. Early 20s. Blonde, who does couples. Couples. And I really can't stress blonde enough. Blonde.
%
Maybe. I don't know. Not really.
%
J&B straight and a Corona.
%
Gimme a break. I'm a child of divorce.
%
I mean I guess I'm a pretty sick guy. So, if you get back tomorrow, I may show up at Harry's Bar. So, you know, keep your eyes OPEN.
%
I have all the characteristics of a human being: flesh, blood, skin, hair; but not a single, clear, identifiable emotion except for greed, and disgust.
%
Something horrible is happening inside of me and I don't know why.
%
My nightly bloodlust has overflown into my days. I feel lethal, on the verge of frenzy.
%
I think my mask of sanity is about to slip.
%
TRY GETTING A RESERVATION AT DORSIA NOW YOU FUCKING STUPID BASTARD!
%
But they should, because it's not just about the pleasures of conformity and the importance of trends; it's also a personal statement about the band itself! HEY PAUL!
%
I think their undisputed masterpiece is "Hip to be Square", a song so catchy, most people probably don't listen to the lyrics.
%
Is that Ivana Trump over there? Jeez, Patrick, I mean Marcus, what are you thinking? Why would Ivana be at Texarkana?
%
*chuckles* Another martini, Paul?
%
In the morning if my face is a little puffy I'll put on an ice pack while doing my stomach crunches. I can do a thousand now.
%
Because I want ... to fit ... in.
%
I'm thinking Dorsia. Wear something fabulous.
%
Don't wear that outfit again. I said, do not wear that outfit again. Wear a dress, a skirt or something.
%
No, just cool it with the anti-semitic remarks.
%
I'm on the verge of tears by the time we arrive at Espace, since I'm positive we won't have a decent table, but we do, and relief washes over me in an awesome wave.
%
Hamilton, have a holly, jolly Christmas.
%
It's, um, cranberry juice, cranapple juice.
%
There is an idea of a Patrick Bateman; some kind of abstraction. But there is no real me: only an entity, something illusory.
%
JUST. SAY. NO!
%
There is a moment of sheer panic when I realize that Paul's apartment overlooks the park... and is obviously more expensive than mine.
%
I hope I'm not being cross-examined here.
%
No, put it in the carton!
%
Listen, you'll have to excuse me. I have a lunch meeting with Cliff Huxtable at the Four Seasons in 20 minutes.
%
Sabrina, don't just stare at it, eat it.
%
I live in the American Gardens Building on West 81st Street on the 11th floor.
%
I believe in taking care of myself, and a balanced diet and a rigorous exercise routine.
%
And though I can hide my cold gaze, and you can shake my hand and feel flesh gripping yours, and maybe you can even sense our lifestyles are probably comparable, I simply am not there.
%
I think "Invisible Touch" was the group's undisputed masterpiece.
%
The song is extremely uplifting. Their lyrics are as positive and affirmative as, uh, anything I've heard in rock.
%
Oh come on. Price. There are a lot more important problems than Sri Lanka to worry about.
%
Sure our foreign policy is important, but there are more pressing problems at hand.
%
Well, we have to end apartheid for one. And slow down the nuclear arms race, stop terrorism and world hunger. But we can't ignore our social needs. either We have to stop people from abusing the welfare system. We have to provide food and shelter for the homeless and oppose racial discrimination and promote civil rights while also promoting equal rights for women but change the abortion laws to protect the right to life yet still somehow maintain women's freedom of choice.
%
We also have to control the influx of illegal immigrants. We have to encourage a return to traditional moral values and curb graphic sex and violence on TV, in movies, in pop music, everywhere. Most importantly we have to promote general social concern and less materialism in young people.
%
I thought you were very fine in "Bartender". I thought it was quite a good movie, and "Top Gun" too. I really thought
that was good.
